      <p class="muted">
        This Concept Note provides a <b>neutral, protocol-agnostic framing</b> of the expression
        <b>“signed response”</b> as a trust primitive: a response that is <b>cryptographically signed</b> so that
        a recipient can verify <b>origin</b>, <b>integrity</b> and basic <b>context</b> before acting.
        The goal is category clarity across identity, authorisation and API interactions.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        <b>Important:</b> this page does <b>not</b> provide security services, audits, certification, PKI,
        penetration testing, or compliance assessment. It provides <b>no</b> legal, regulatory or security advice.
        It is not an official portal of any standards body (including OASIS, OpenID Foundation, W3C or IETF),

      <p class="muted">
        SignedResponse.com is presented as a <b>descriptive digital asset</b> that a legitimate acquirer could
        steward as a taxonomy, reference hub, or governance vocabulary layer for “signed responses”.

    <!-- 1. WHY THIS PRIMITIVE MATTERS -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">1. Why the primitive matters</div>
      <h2>Trust at scale increasingly depends on short machine-readable responses</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Modern systems route critical decisions through responses: authentication responses in SSO, authorisation responses
        returned via front-channel flows, API replies carrying decisions, and machine outputs feeding automated workflows.
        In these settings, an unsigned or weakly protected response becomes a high-leverage attack surface.
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip"><b>Origin:</b> who produced this response, and is that issuer authentic?</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Integrity:</b> was the response altered in transit (injection, tampering, substitution)?</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Context:</b> is this response bound to the intended recipient, session, audience or request?</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Actionability:</b> can the recipient safely act on it with a clear verification rule?</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        “Signed response” is a concise way to talk about these guarantees without locking the discussion to a single protocol.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 2. WHERE IT APPEARS TODAY -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">2. Where it appears today</div>
      <h2>Cross-protocol reality</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The mechanics differ by ecosystem, but the design intent is similar: the receiver verifies a signature before trusting the response.
        The same framing can cover multiple worlds without claiming a single “official standard” for the term.
      </p>

      <h3>2.1 Identity and SSO</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          In federated identity, responses delivered by an identity provider are commonly signed (or contain signed statements)
          so a service provider can verify authenticity before granting access.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          The practical risk is not theoretical: misconfiguration, missing verification, or incorrect signature handling is a known
          weakness in real-world deployments.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>2.2 Authorization flows</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          In high-value authorization contexts, ecosystems have defined mechanisms where authorization responses can be packaged and
          protected as signed structures, reducing exposure to front-channel manipulation.
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>2.3 APIs and automated decisioning</h3>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">
          API responses often carry decisions (routing, pricing, eligibility, compliance flags). A signed response framing helps
          structure how verification, replay resistance and recipient binding are discussed at the architecture level.
        </div>
        <div class="chip">
          In automated workflows and agentic systems, signed outputs can be treated as “verifiable responses” that preserve provenance
          and reduce ambiguity about who said what, when, and under which constraints.
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- 3. TERMINOLOGY -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">3. Terminology</div>
      <h2>Response vs. statement vs. payload</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Different ecosystems use different nouns. A protocol-agnostic banner should remain descriptive:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip"><b>Response:</b> the top-level message returned to a relying party (often short-lived, action-triggering).</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Statement / assertion:</b> a signed claim set embedded in or carried by a response.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Payload:</b> the structured content being signed (XML/JSON/JWT), independent of transport.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Verification rule:</b> how a recipient decides which keys, issuers, audiences and validity windows are acceptable.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        This Concept Note intentionally avoids protocol-specific operational guidance. The focus is the governance vocabulary:
        “a response that must be signed and verified before action”.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 4. DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (NON-OPERATIONAL) -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">4. Design constraints</div>
      <h2>Verification principles (high-level)</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        A signed response framing is only meaningful if verification is unambiguous. At a high level, governance and architecture
        discussions typically revolve around:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip"><b>Issuer identification:</b> accepted issuers and key material must be explicitly managed.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Audience / recipient binding:</b> the response is intended for a specific relying party or client.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Freshness:</b> validity windows and replay resistance are part of the trust envelope.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Context binding:</b> linking a response to an initiating request reduces substitution risk.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Failure behavior:</b> what happens when verification fails must be deterministic and safe.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        These points are presented as descriptive constraints, not as implementation instructions. The domain is positioned for
        conceptual framing and governance language, not operational security guidance.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 5. WHY A NEUTRAL BANNER -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">5. Why a neutral banner matters</div>
      <h2>Separating taxonomy from vendor positioning</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        “Signed response” intersects with multiple ecosystems: identity, open finance, API security, and automation. In such a landscape,
        vendor pages tend to describe the concept through a single product lens. A neutral banner can provide:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip">A stable definition that remains usable across cycles of standards and products.</div>
        <div class="chip">A curated map of how the term appears across protocols, without implying endorsement.</div>
        <div class="chip">A governance vocabulary layer for procurement, assurance and architecture dialogue.</div>
        <div class="chip">Clear guardrails: non-affiliation, no services, and descriptive-only posture.</div>
      </div>
      <p class="muted">
        The domain name itself does not create authority. Authority depends on the legitimacy of any future steward and its governance safeguards.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- 6. RELATION TO INTEGRITY STACK -->
    <section class="card">
      <div class="section-tag">6. Relation to broader integrity themes</div>
      <h2>Message integrity sits on top of platform integrity</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Signed responses protect the <b>message layer</b>. Many ecosystems also require trust in the <b>compute layer</b> that produces
        those responses, especially when decisions are automated or high-value. A coherent integrity stack may include:
      </p>
      <div class="list">
        <div class="chip"><b>Compute integrity:</b> the environment producing responses is running intended code on a trustworthy platform.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Signed responses:</b> recipients verify origin and integrity of the response before action.</div>
        <div class="chip"><b>Governance:</b> policies and assurance language define which proofs are acceptable and why.</div>
